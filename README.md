### About project
***
- I developed a simple E-commerce website. Which helps the user to login, register and order products. If the user is a new user, it helps him to register and then helps him to login to the site. There is an option to add products to the cart by pressing button “add to cart”. User can purchase products by adding them to cart. And there some ads are displayed in the slideshow in the index page.
***
### Future development
***
- It's my future plan to implement it further by adding payment options and developing it as user friendly.
***
### Bugs and issues

- At present I developed up to the add to cart.
- I didn’t develop payment options.
